friends who can post messages on each others' walls

Run the server file in the console and then follow the instructions provided

If the ID initiailly entered does not exist, it will be created

The user is then "logged in" and can simply call commands without having to specify their own id

The four commands are add, post, display and exit

If a user enters a username which is more than one word, only the first word will be accepted into the program

The program will run until the user enters the exit command
