friends who can post messages on each others' walls

Run the client script with the parameter of a user or alternatively run the server script in one terminal and the client script in another

Running the client script before the server will simply start the server script in the background

If the ID initially entered does not exist, it will be created

The user is then "logged in" and can simply call commands without having to specify their own id

The three commands are add, post, display and exit

If a user enters a username which is more than one word, only the first word will be accepted into the program

The server will run until there are no clients left to use it
